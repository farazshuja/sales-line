# Setting up dev env
Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
Install yarn from https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/

1. Run command `yarn` in the root folder, it will install all the dev dependencies
2. To develop, run command `yarn start` it will start http://localhost:8080, edit the files in src/ folder and changes will be automatically visible.
3. Once you are done with modification run command `yarn build`. It will generate files in dist/ folder which you can use on production.
